# PyCoinFlipper
An Advanced Python program that flips coins and finds out the data from it. It takes advantage of directories and is my first big project where I made something with multiple libraries, files ,directories and it even had settings, which is a development in my learning of python hugely.
# Usage
simply enter the number of coins you want to calculate and then it will create the following data:
- Number of heads
- Number of tails
- Total number of heads and tails (total coin count)
- List of all the 1's and 2's in the coin data
# Settings
If you want to change the settings after disabling the startup text you can go into settings.txt.
Currently there are 2 settings available.
# Prerequisites

- Random Libary
